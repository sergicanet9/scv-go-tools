| Package           | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------ |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| api/middlewares   | HTTP middlewares for panic recovery, JWT authentication, role-based authorization, and request/response logging.                                                                  |
| api/interceptors  | gRPC interceptors providing equivalent functionality to HTTP middlewares, supporting both unary and stream gRPC calls.                                                            |
| api/utils         | Utility functions for sending HTTP and gRPC success/error responses with proper status code management, and JSON unmarshalling from files with support for parsing time.Duration. |
| infrastructure    | Connection management for MongoDB and PostgreSQL, a PostgreSQL migration runner, and a generic MongoDB repository implementation.                                                 |
| mocks             | Mock creation for MongoDB and PostgreSQL repositories to facilitate unit testing.                                                                                                 |
| observability     | New Relic integration for APM and log forwarding, including a singleton logger.                                                                                                   |
| repository        | Interface for the Repository pattern defining CRUD operations, designed for multiple storage implementations and extensibility through composition.                               |
| wrappers          | Custom type wrappers including specialized error types for simpler error code mapping and a gRPC Server Stream wrapper for enabling context injection.                            |
| testutils         | Convenient utility functions to simplify testing.                                                                                                                                 |
